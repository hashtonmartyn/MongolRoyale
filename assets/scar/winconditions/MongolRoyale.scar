EXAMPLE GAME MODE SCRIPT

This script demonstrates how to use an assortment of SCAR (Scripting at Relic) functions to create a Game Mode for Age of Empires IV. 
We demonstrate how to setup a simple win condition that awards victory to the first player who constructs 5 houses and covers an assortment of topics like building/unit spawning, event tracking, and much more.

Search for the following topic titles (e.g. OPTIONS, RULES, etc.) in this script to see examples of their usage. 

- OPTIONS allow you to add buttons to the Skirmish/Custom lobby when your Game Mode is selected and trigger functions based on what the host has selected. The buttons are added in the Options section of the Win Condition .rdo file and their functionality is driven by this script.
- RULES allow you to call script functions after a delay, on an interval, or whenever a game event (e.g. a unit is killed) occurs.
- OBJECTIVES communicate what the players' goals are and how they are progressing towards them using a UI element at the top left of their screen.
- ENTITIES are the objects you see in-game, like player constructed buildings, Sacred Sites, Stone Deposits, and Trees. Type "Entity_" in this script to view a list of functions you can use to manipulate these objects.
- SQUADS are in-game units. Type "Squad_" in this script to view a list of functions you can use to manipulate these objects.
- ENTITY GROUPS and SQUAD GROUPS (aka EGROUPS/SGROUPS) are bundles of Entities/Squads. It sometimes makes sense to add a number of objects to a group so you can manipulate them together (e.g. you may want to add a group of Spearmen to an SGROUP so you can command them all to attack a location).
- UPGRADES unlock functionality for a player, a unit, or a building.
- BLUEPRINTS are the instructions needed to create an Entity, Squad, or Upgrade. For example, a blueprint exists for each Civilization Villager. If you want to spawn a Mongol Villager, you will need to reference the Mongol Villager Blueprint. Type "BP_" in this script to view a list of Blueprint functions.
- EVENT CUES are messages that appear in the queue at the bottom-right of the player's screen. Some event cues occur automatically, like when an upgrade completes. You can configure your own event cues to communicate important game mode events to the player.

To play and test this Game Mode:

1. From the editor toolbar, select File > Save All to save any changes you have made to this mod.
2. From the editor toolbar, select Build > Build Mod.
3. Launch Age of Empires IV.
4. In the game client, navigate to Single Player > Skirmish > Create Game (alternatively, you can navigate to Multiplayer > Custom > Create Game).
5. In the Game Setup tab of the lobby, select the Edit button.
6. Select your Game Mode* and Start Game.

*Your Game Mode will have a red wrench icon next to it. This means that it is a local mod and you cannot launch with other players in the lobby. If you would like to play this Game Mode with other players, you will either need to:
1. Share your mod file with another player and have them place it in the following directory: YourDriveHere:\Users\YourNameHere\Documents\My Games\Cardinal\mods\extension\local 
2. Publish your Mod from the Mods > My Mods screen. This will publish your Game Mode to all Age of Empires IV players! When a host selects your Game Mode, it will automatically be downloaded for other players in the lobby.
